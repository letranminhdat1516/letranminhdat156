## I'm Le Tran Minh Dat

I'm a developer who enjoys exploring new technologies and turning ideas into working systems.

I like building backend architectures, experimenting with new tools, and continuously improving how systems are designed and deployed. Most of my work starts from curiosity and evolves into something functional and practical.

Outside of coding, I enjoy playing games and connecting with people. I value collaboration, clear communication, and learning from different perspectives.
